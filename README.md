## âš¡ AdvancedTesla (SCP: Secret Laboratory EXILED Plugin)

**AdvancedTesla** is a plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory built on the **EXILED API**, designed to make **Tesla Gates more dynamic, interactive, and dangerous**.
It introduces both **smart bypass mechanics** based on player inventory and a chaotic "**Crazy Tesla**" mode that triggers gates periodically, creating immersive and unpredictable scenarios.

### ðŸ§  What It Does

* When a player approaches a Tesla Gate **with a permitted item**:

  * The Tesla is **automatically disabled**.
  * The player receives a **custom hint** (e.g., based on their role).
* If **Crazy Tesla** mode is enabled:

  * Tesla Gates will **activate on a timer**, creating random electrical hazards.
  * **Forced Tesla activations** can be triggered via code (for events or scripted chaos).
  * A **custom CASSIE message** plays during each activation.

Great for **RP servers**, **event-based gameplay**, or just adding a little more **danger and unpredictability** to standard rounds.
